## 🎮 How to Play

### Controls
- **Movement**: Use `WASD` or `Arrow Keys` to control your receiver
- **Objective**: Catch as many footballs as possible while avoiding red penalties

### Game Flow
1. **Start**: Click "Start Game" from the main menu
2. **Round 1**: 30 seconds to learn the mechanics
3. **Round 2**: 20 seconds with increased football speed
4. **Round 3**: 10 seconds for maximum challenge
5. **Results**: View your performance rating and earned XP

### Scoring Strategy
- Prioritize **blue footballs** for maximum points (+5)
- Collect **yellow footballs** for steady scoring (+2)
- **Avoid red footballs** at all costs (-5 penalty)
- Each round increases difficulty with faster movement and more spawns

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Separate classes for Player, Football, and Game state
- **60fps Game Loop**: Smooth animation using `requestAnimationFrame`
- **Collision Detection**: AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) for precise interactions
- **State Management**: Clean separation between game screens and logic

### Key Technologies
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Hardware-accelerated 2D graphics rendering
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: ES6+ features with modern syntax
- **CSS3**: Flexbox layout with responsive design principles
- **Local Storage**: Potential for saving high scores (future enhancement)

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient collision detection algorithms
- Minimal DOM manipulation during gameplay
- Optimized canvas drawing operations
- Memory management for game objects

## 🔧 Development

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with HTML5 Canvas support
- Local web server (optional but recommended for development)

### Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome 80+
- ✅ Firefox 75+
- ✅ Safari 13+
- ✅ Edge 80+

### Development Guidelines
```javascript
// Game configuration example
const GAME_CONFIG = {
    CANVAS_WIDTH: 800,
    CANVAS_HEIGHT: 600,
    ROUNDS: [
        { duration: 30, spawnRate: 2000, speedMultiplier: 1 },
        { duration: 20, spawnRate: 1500, speedMultiplier: 1.3 },
        { duration: 10, spawnRate: 1000, speedMultiplier: 1.6 }
    ]
};
```

### Code Style
- ES6+ features and modern JavaScript patterns
- Object-oriented programming for game entities
- Consistent naming conventions and clear comments
- Separation of concerns between game logic, rendering, and UI

## 🎯 Game Balance

The game is carefully tuned for optimal challenge progression:

- **Round 1 (30s)**: Learning phase with moderate spawn rate
- **Round 2 (20s)**: Increased pace to build tension
- **Round 3 (10s)**: Maximum challenge requiring focus and skill

Football distribution is weighted to ensure fair but challenging gameplay:
- **Blue/Yellow**: 80% of spawns (positive scoring)
- **Red**: 20% of spawns (penalties)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- 🔊 **Audio System**: Sound effects and background music
- 👥 **Multiplayer Mode**: Competitive receiving challenges
- 🎨 **Character Customization**: Different receiver types and abilities
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard**: Detailed performance tracking
- 🏅 **Achievement System**: Unlockable rewards and badges
- 💾 **Cloud Saves**: Cross-device progress synchronization

### Technical Improvements
